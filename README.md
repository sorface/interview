There are three types of participants in each room:  

### 1. **Collaborator**.  
- Turns on the video camera and microphone.  
- Answers questions and solves problems.  
- The protagonist of the interview! 🎤  

### 2. **Interviewer**.  
- Manages the process: switches questions, turns on the code editor.  
- Writes feedback and assigns grades.  
- Can turn on video camera and microphone.  
- A true master of the interview! 🧑‍🏫  

### 3. **Viewer**  
- Observes the process without being able to intervene.

## 🛠️ How does it work?

### 1. **Create a Room**  
Create a room, provide a name, select questions from the catalog, and schedule a meeting date and time.  

### 2. **Invite Participants**  
Send the room link to candidates and other participants.  

### 3. **Conduct the interview**. 
- Interviewee answers questions and solves problems.  
- Interviewees manage the process, score and write feedback.  
- The interviewee observes and can chat.  

### 4. **Completion and Analysis**  
After the meeting, interviewers see draft scores and write an overall comment. Once all feedback is submitted, the room closes and you get:  
- The candidate's average score.  
- The scores and comments for each question.  
- A transcription of the discussion.
